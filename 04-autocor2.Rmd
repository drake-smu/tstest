# Autocorrelation Concepts and Notation

## Theoretical concept of $\rho$

$$\rho = \frac{E\left[\left(X-\mu_X\right)\left(Y-\mu_Y\right)\right]}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y} = \frac{\mathrm{covariance between X+y}}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}$$

In a stationary time series, we have autocorrelation and autocovariance

## autocovariance

$$\gamma_k = E\left[\left(X_t - \mu\right)\left(X_{t+k} - \mu\right)\right]$$

## autocorrelation 

$$\rho_k =\frac{E\left[\left(X_t - \mu\right)\left(X_{t+k} - \mu\right)\right]}{\sigma_{X_t} \sigma_{X_{t+k}}} = \frac{E\left[\left(X_t - \mu\right)\left(X_{t+k} - \mu\right)\right]}{\sigma^2_X} = \frac{\gamma_k}{\sigma_X^2}$$

This works because of constant variance and constant mean!

Note that in a stationary time series:

$$\sigma_X^2 = 1E[(X_t - \mu)^2] = E[(X_t -\mu )(X_t - \mu)] = \gamma_0$$

Therefore:

$$\rho_k = \frac{\gamma_k}{\gamma_0}$$
