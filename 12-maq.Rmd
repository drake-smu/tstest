# MA(q) Models

## Properties and Characteristics

We use MA models to model stationary data. They are not quite as useful as AR models, but in conjunction with them, we can create ARMA(p,q) models and so forth.

## MA(q)

First of all, we need to define the equation for a Moving Average Model of order q:
$$X_t = \mu + a_t - \theta_1 a_{t-1} - ... - \theta_q a_{t-q}$$
